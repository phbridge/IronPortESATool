# EULA
 This software is provided as is and with zero support level. Support can be purchased by providing Phil bridges
 with a variety of Beer, Wine, Steak and Greggs pasties. Please contact phbridge@cisco.com for support costs and
 arrangements. Until provision of alcohol or baked goodies your on your own but there is no rocket science
 involved so dont panic too much. To accept this EULA you must include the correct flag when running the script.
 If this script goes crazy wrong and breaks everything then your also on your own and Phil will not accept any
 liability of any type or kind. As this script belongs to Phil and NOT Cisco then Cisco cannot be held
 responsible for its use or if it goes bad, nor can Cisco make any profit from this script. Phil can profit
 from this script but will not assume any liability. Other than the boring stuff please enjoy and plagiarise
 as you like (as I have no ways to stop you) but common courtesy says to credit me in some way.
 [see above comments on Beer, Wine, Steak and Greggs.].
